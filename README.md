In order to make sure microservice works correctly, please install pandas package by typing pip install pandas using PyPl.
Make sure database.txt file is saved in same folder as movie_log.py
This will be the same folder microservice will create and export sorted data as database.csv

once you open file movie_log.py using Pycharm, click Run 'movie_log.py'
once you click the run file then msg will pop up on the pycharm screen " Would you like to request data? answer 'yes' or 'no': "
you will have to type "yes" then movie_log.py. 
Once "yes" is typed and pressed enter by you, program will REQUEST data from the text file(database.txt) that you wrote.
program will RECEIVE data from text file then it will automatically sort the data based on 'My Score'(as requested).
Once sorting process is then through the program then it will create CSV file(as requested) name as 'database.csv' with new sorted information without changing original document(text file).
